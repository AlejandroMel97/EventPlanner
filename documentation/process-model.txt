Process Model

Process Model followed: Agile Scrum

Arguments:

Reasoning Agile is acceptable for this project:
The project wasn't overwhelming in size, so if
quick changes or fixes needed to be done, it was easy enough to
do those on the fly
 

Reasoning for following Agile:
We put finishing the assignment as the most important factor
It took a lot of changes throughout the entire project, up
until the very end where we delete several pages of HTML and js
for the sake of simplicity and ease of use
We tested code frequently to make sure that it worked each step of the
way
Our most effective method of communication was face to face,
trying to make that happen as often as possible
We were flexible in when we finished certain parts of the code, it wasn't
one big long run or consistent output

Reasoning for Scrum specifically:
At the beginning of the project, we tried to come up with a generic
list of requirements and divide it up into small projects
We tested the code along the way, making sure that it works at every
step of the way
